Michael Parker <ivqrnai@pobox.com>,SpamAssassin Dev <xrh@spamassassin.apache.org>,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 17:31:20 -0600",Re: svn commit: r619753 - in /spamassassin/trunk: lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Util/RegistrarBoundaries.pm t/uri_text.t,"Would anyone object to removing .so from this list?  The .so TLD is  
basically dead and we've found that lots of bogus domains like lib*.so  
are being caught by this.  Also sometimes you'll have spammers who are  
putting in gibberish or funny punctuation and you'll get sentences  
like 'blah blah.So this is'.  It also occurs with a couple of other  
domains but .so is by far the worst.

For more info on the .so domain you can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.so_%28domain_name%29

The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

Each row represents an ""EVENT"": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A ""User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary"" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out. Kind regards, Guido Budziak -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

# Please include the string:  [perl #46011]
# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. 
# 


This is a bug report for perl from hzyoze@fysh.org,
generated with the help of perlbug 1.35 running under perl v5.8.8.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Please enter your report here]

This perl is configured with 64-bit integers and 64-bit floats (1+52
bits of significand).

$ perl -lwe '{ package t0; sub mynum { 36028797018963971 } use overload ""0+"" => \\&mynum } print int(t0::mynum); print int(bless({}, ""t0""))'
36028797018963971
36028797018963968
$

36028797018963971 is 2^55+3.  Its salient feature here is that it's
a native integer that can't be exactly represented as a native float.
When it's returned by the ""0+"" overload function, it's being unnecessarily
and lossily coerced to float.  This coercion doesn't happen if the
return value of t0::mynum() goes directly into int() without going via
the overloading system.

Not I.

Looks like the -x flag on du is broken.

Worst-case scenario is loss of personal data, and/or
run-away process which consumes resources (memory or
disk space if not constrained by ulimit or quota) until
there's a system crash.

What you WON'T have to do is reinstall the whole system.

You see...the whole Unix security model PRESUMED that
a user might (either unintentionally or intentionally)
write and/or execute a run-away process which could
be destructive.  Write-permissions (or lack of them)
prevent the process from doing damage to anything other
than the user's own personal files.

FWIW, the behaviour of the two examples is what I would have expected.
(Though I had to think about the second case a bit: initially I expected
it to do exactly what the first case does.)

>From perlvar:
         $
               Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
               parentheses from the last pattern match, not counting patterns
               matched in nested blocks that have been exited already.
               (Mnemonic: like \\digits.)  These variables are all read-only
               and dynamically scoped to the current BLOCK.

It is unfortunate that the documentation does not more carefully define
what it means by ""nested block"" here: from the point of view of the read
access of $1 in the examples, the inner match is not occurring in a nested
block. From the point of view of the program as a whole, the second case
certainly contains a nested block; the first case might or might not,
depending what ""nested"" means; the first case also either might or might
not have ""exited"" its block (nested or no), depending on precisely what
""exited"" means - my own interpretation is that it hasn't exited the block
yet, but that's a sentiment based more on my limited understanding of the
implementation than on any documentation.

If we can work out what the documentation is supposed to be saying, and
what all the words mean, maybe we have a better chance of deciding whether
the implementation matches that, and if not, fixing it.

A customer is looking for a book that may have been written about the disappearance in June of 1972, of a young boy (Adrian McNaughton) in the Holmes' Lake area of Brougham Township in Renfrew County (Ottawa Valley area of Ontario). He was 6 years old at the time.

She recalls having seen something about it in the past (other than printed news reports. Perhaps a bound official report? An article in a magazine?).

Any information or leads (even a ""yes - there is"" or ""no - there isn't"") would be much appreciated.

Kindest regards - John Lynch.

to branch 3.2 and then applying the bug 5813 fix on top of it. So I'm calling

But wenn I setup the filters in KMail I get all mails turned back as UNSURE.

I use this to check my mails:
 crm -u $HOME/.crm114 mailreaver.crm

To move the unsure mails to spam, if they are, I use:
 crm -u $HOME/.crm114 mailreaver.crm --spam

To move the unsure mails to ham, if they are, I use:
 crm -u $HOME/.crm114 mailreaver.crm --good

But when I then send the same mails though the same filters again, they are still detected as UNSURE

Guess I need some help at this point. I assume that I have somewhere a problem in my setup..

In actuality, MS Windows and other products suffer chronic security
problems because MS deliberately places backdoors in their products.

Ever notice how it sometimes takes MONTHS between when a windows
security problem is first reported, and when the problem is finally
admitted, right as they are releasing the patch?

That's because sometimes it takes that long to not only close
the backdoor which the crackers have discovered, but to ALSO
*CREATE* A NEW BACKDOOR so that they can continue monitoring
(and spying upon) the customer base.

Yep.  See above.

Unix and Linux are written with the idea that multiple users
will be logged in at the same time, that all of them are
creative, but not infallible programmers, and the system
must be resiliant enough to prevent any user's faulty code
from crashing or destroying the whole system.

This is the basis of the *nix security model.



Windows is written with the idea that everybody is perfect,
and nothing bad or unexpected happens -- EVER.

This is why Windows doesn't really have a security model.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS) invites participation in 
the CEAS Live Spam Challenge. Participants will compete in filtering a 
live 24-hour e-mail stream delivered using standard protocols (SMTP, 
IMAP4, POP3). All types of anti-spam technology are welcome including 
servers, appliances, proxies and personal filters. Participants will be 
allowed to use any network resource including real-time blacklists, 
real-time white-lists, reverse-DNS queries, and privately owned and 
updated databases.

Simulated user-feedback will be provided to train learning-based 
filters. Filters will be evaluated based on a weighted combination of 
the percentage of spam blocked and its false positive percentage.

The challenge will be held in conjunction with the Fourth Annual 
Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS). Conference registration and 
attendance is not required for participation.

Please see http://www.ceas.cc/challenge for competition details and 
instructions on joining the competition e-mail list.

Ah... the problem is the *

You're going to have to explicitly list all of the directories
that are on the root partition on the command line, WITHOUT
listing any mountpoints (/home, /usr, whatever)

By using *, you effectively said ""stay within ANY AND ALL of the
filesystems containing these directories"", including any
filesystem with a mountpoint in the / directory (i.e. /proc,

No.  Just before my mobilization began in April 2006, I
had purchased 10.0 in the store.

Then in August 2006, after we finished our pre-deployment
training, we had a 4-day pass to go home and visit for a
bit before getting deployed... which is when I found
10.1 on the shelf (put together by some outfit like
Walnut Creek or something).  I installed 10.1 in tent
in Kuwait (thank God we had electricity and air
conditioning!)

BREAKING NEWS & ALERT: 
USDA REPORT INDICATES THAT ORGANIC LABELING FRAUD IS INCREASING
The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Organic Program (NOP) announced this week that 15 of the 30 accredited organic certifiers they recently inspected failed the USDA audit and will have 12 months to make corrections or lose their accreditation with the NOP. Although the USDA euphemistically calls their enforcement actions ""renewal pending subsequent audit,"" it is clear that there are numerous violations of organic standards taking place in the U.S. and across the world. A number of the violations noted in the several hundred page audit related to Chinese imports certified by the French-based organic certifier Ecocert and other certifiers.

Strangely enough, Quality Assurance International (QAI), the largest organic certifier in the world, is not cited by the USDA, even though the OCA has recently reviewed documents that indicate that QAI is indeed under investigation by the NOP. QAI has recently been in the news for sourcing ginger, contaminated with a dangerous and banned pesticide, Aldicarb, from its Chinese certification sub-contractors and then labeling it as ""USDA Organic."" QAI is also under public fire, along with other certifiers, for certifying factory farm feedlot dairies supplying milk to Horizon and Aurora Organic Dairy, who in turn supply Wal-Mart, Costco, Safeway, and other organic private label organic milk.

ALERT OF THE WEEK: 
SENATOR SAYS STOP BRAINWASHING CHILDREN TO EAT JUNK FOOD
A new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report has revealed that food and beverage corporations spent $1.6 billion dollars in food advertising in 2006. As parents and public health officials understand, the nation's alarming surge in childhood obesity and diabetes are directly related to increased consumption of junk food. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) has urged industry and government regulators to redirect the massive funds spent every year in junk food advertising toward education and programs focused on healthy eating.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:
""Globalized industrialized food is not cheap: it is too costly for the Earth, for the farmers, for our health. The Earth can no longer carry the burden of groundwater mining, pesticide pollution, disappearance of species and destabilization of the climate. Farmers can no longer carry the burden of debt, which is inevitable in industrial farming with its high costs of production. It is incapable of producing safe, culturally appropriate, tasty, quality food. And it is incapable of producing enough food for all because it is wasteful of land, water and energy. Industrial agriculture uses ten times more energy than it produces. It is thus ten times less efficient.""

Dr. Vandana Shiva, scientist, world-renowned author, and grassroots leader in India. Member of the Policy Advisory Board of the Organic Consumers Association.

PLUNDER OF THE WEEK: 
SIX TIMES MORE FISH FED TO LIVESTOCK THAN TO HUMANS
According to the UBS Fisheries Centre in Vancouver, B.C., despite rampant over-fishing and depletion of world fish populations, globally, we are now feeding 14 million tons of edible wild-caught fish to factory farm animals, like pigs and chickens, each year. That amounts to over six times the amount of fish the entire U.S. population eats annually. Wild fish fed to animals on a massive scale include perfectly edible anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and herring, which are ground into a cheap fishmeal and sold for animal feed. In other words a protein source is being fed to animals on corporate farms with a 90% energy loss. Given the global food crisis and the over-harvesting of many of the ocean's commercial fish varieties, careful analysis of resource use by the global industrial food complex is becoming a life or death imperative.

________________________________

SUSTAINABILITY TIPS OF THE WEEK: 
MICRO-GENERATION AND MICRO-FARMING
As energy and food prices continue to rise, global experts predict that micro-generation and micro-farming will boom over the next few years. New trends in urban farming, like vertical gardening and backyard chickens, can help feed households in an economical and earth friendly way. New technologies in micro-generation, powering your home with a wind turbine or solar paneling, for example, are making off-the-grid living more financially feasible than ever. In fact, priorities in Silicon Valley are already shifting from developing better microchips towards focusing on thin-film solar cells. Meanwhile, programs like 'Solar City' are offering 20% savings in solar paneling installations for neighborhoods who buy in bulk.

HOW TO STOP FAST FOOD FROM TAKING OVER YOUR CITY
The Los Angeles City Council has agreed to ban the building of new fast food restaurants in poor areas of the city. Three-quarters of the restaurants in South L.A. are fast food, and the City Council hopes the decision will attract healthier alternatives. The decision was made after area residents complained that junk food was destroying public health. The resolution is likely to be used as a model by other cities where similar citizen campaigns are launched. Learn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_13834.cfm

Gang Chen <gangchen6@gmail.com>,r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 14:26:31 -0400",[R] Mixed model with multiple response variables?,"Hi,

I have a data set collected from 10 measurements (response variables)
on two groups (healthy and patient) of subjects performing 4 different
tasks. In other words there are two fixed factors (group and task),
and 10 response variables. I could analyze the data with aov() or
lme() in package nlme for each response variable separately, but since
most likely there are correlations among the 10 response variables,
would it be more meaningful to run a MANOVA? However manova() in R
seems not to allow an error term in the formula. What else can I try
for this kind of multivariate mixed model?

Also, if I want to find out which response variables (among the 10
measurements) are statistically significant in terms of acting as
indicators for group difference, what kind of statistical analysis
would help me sort them out?

Thanks in advance,
Gang

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
